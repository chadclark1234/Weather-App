## Weather Dashboard

The weather dashboard project goal was to build a weather application that used the OpenWeather API to access weather information for cities around the world. The application is to be responsive on many different screen sizes.

## Challenges

This project was by far the most enjoyable one yet. When I first started the assignment, I really struggled with it. After a couple weeks of improving my JavaScript skills, when I came back to work on it the second time, I was excited to see the improvement in my knowledge in that short time. The biggest challenge for me on this project was to dynamically create the buttons and also make them operate. I added two additional features that were not a requirement, wind direction and the reset button. The wind direction required a little bit more logic as it is given in degrees.
